Home Automation Project

Introduction

This project is a terminal-based home automation system developed using Java. It allows users to manage and control multiple devices such as lights, fans, air conditioners, televisions, and heaters. Users can add devices, turn them on or off, and check their current status, all from the terminal interface.

This program demonstrates the application of six design patterns to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The project is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/JoaoDeodatoPereira/SoftawareProject, and all code is included in a zip file for submission.

Cooperation

This project was a collaborative effort between two team members:

Jo√£o Pereira: Focused on the core application logic, including the implementation of the Singleton, Factory, and Facade design patterns. They were responsible for:

Main.java

HomeAutomationApp.java

DeviceController.java

DeviceFactory.java

Chavdar Tsvetkov: Focused on creating the interface and concrete device classes, implementing the Observer and Iterator design patterns. They contributed:

Device.java

Concrete device classes (Light.java, Fan.java, AirConditioner.java, Television.java, Heater.java)

Observer and Iterator logic for device management.

The contributions from both team members were balanced and ensured a well-rounded implementation of the program.
